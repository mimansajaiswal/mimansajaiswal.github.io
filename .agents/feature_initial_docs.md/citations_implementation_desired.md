Core Features

1. “Cite This Page” Section
	*	Appears at the end of each post, after footnotes but before interlinked content.
	*	Automatically generates a BibTeX entry for the current page.
	*	Displayed in a code block for easy copying.
	*	Can be toggled on or off via configuration.

2. BibTeX Citation Processing
	*	Supports linking to public .bib files from:
	*	GitHub Gist
	*	GitHub Repo
	*	Dropbox
	*	Google Drive
	*	Multiple .bib file URLs can be provided.
	*	Automatically extracts and processes entries.
	*	Normalizes share links to direct-download URLs and provides instructions or endpoints for last-updated timestamps.

	*	Timestamp Retrieval:

curl -s https://api.github.com/gists/dd0ea3c71898e6d7557d0b2a6b0f95f5 | jq '.updated_at'


⸻

2. GitHub Repo File
	*	Input: https://github.com/nerdymomocat-templates/bibfile-tester-webtrotion/blob/main/bibtex-test-webtr-github.bib
	*	Download URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nerdymomocat-templates/bibfile-tester-webtrotion/main/bibtex-test-webtr-github.bib

	*	Download URL: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/vrtoh0mi2hsjwybu9s6gb/bibtex-test-webtr-dropbox.bib?dl=1
	*	Updated URL: None
	*	Notes: Dropbox shared links do not expose public timestamps; use Dropbox API for server_modified.

4. Google Drive Shared File
	*	Input: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GC98kFZeR1aUGIK1q8-9RirTTnQHl0KC/view?usp=sharing
	*	Download URL: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1GC98kFZeR1aUGIK1q8-9RirTTnQHl0KC
	*	Updated URL: None
	*	Notes: Google Drive shared links do not expose public timestamps; use Drive API for modifiedTime.

5. Unknown / Unsupported Source
	*	Download URL: Original link
	*	Updated URL: None
	*	Notes: Only GitHub Gist, GitHub Repo, Dropbox, and Google Drive are supported.

Helper Function: get_bib_source_info()
	*	Purpose: Convert a share link to a direct-download URL and provide a method to check last update (if possible).
	*	Returns a dict:

{
  "source": "github",
  "download_url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/main/path/to/mycollection.bib",
  "updated_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/user/repo/commits?path=path/to/mycollection.bib",
  "updated_instructions": "Use `curl -s ... | jq '.[0].commit.committer.date'` to get last modified timestamp."
}

The downloaded bib file would then be processed into the format decided and stored in json format with key, attribution replacement and the formatted entry. This can also be cached for performance. With github and and gist we can use the updated_url to check if the file has changed since last fetch based on LAST BUILD TIME variable. Otherwise we'll have to fetch and process every time. You'll probably need to store in json in tmp somewhere url, last updated, respective processed entries bib file, as well downladed file name. make sure whatever library we use for this, we keep as small as possible, tree-shake it if possible.

3. In-Text Citation Shortcodes
	*	Recognizes: #cite(key), \cite{key}, [@key]
	*	Renders in-text as [Author et al., Year]. This would have popover that shows the formatted entry on hover/click similar to footnotes (but automatically) which can be mapped based on the processed bibtex entries from the previous step.
	* We use [Author et al., Year] format for apa and [1][2] format for simplified-ieee.
	* Remember numbering is difficult because keys can be repeated and we want to number in order of first appearance. We will be populating a dict of number, key anyway, but I wanted to mention this.

4. Bibliography Formatting
	*	Automatically generates a bibliography section at the end of the post for all keys used in a page ordered alphabetically for apa. For simplified-ieee ordered by appearance. Only fitlers to those used on a page.
	*	Supports APA, and Simplified IEEE (used in iclr/neurips etc) styles (uses numbering, same numbering assigned in order).
	* These days papers sometimes have 500 authors, in which case, let's cap it to max 8 authors then et al.
	* If section is enabled in config, it would be rendered after interlinked content. Similar to interlinked content, add at [marker] [marker] where each marker is the backlink to the block which used the key for this formatted entry and will behave the same way (hover/click to show popover original block without reference).

5. "intext-display": {
					// If true, the formatted bibliography entry will always appear as a popup on click.
					"always-popup": false,
					// (Recommended) On large screens, displays formatted bibliography entry  in the margin. On smaller screens, it falls back to a popup.
					"small-popup-large-margin": true,
				},

	If it is always-popup true, then every in-text citation would show the formatted entry as a popup on click. If small-popup-large-margin is true, then on large screens it would show in margin on hover and on small screens it would show as popup on click. The thing to note here is if there is a citation inside footnote content, we do process them too and in formatted entry backlink it links to the block which had the footnote marker or if margin is enabled and visible, then to the margin citation content.
	Another thing to note is if margin is true, we need to find a way to work with margin.ts such that there are no overlaps in footnote arrangement and citation arrangement in margin. If margin is true and there is a citation in footnote content in margin, then we can insert the citation formatted entry below the footnote content in margin, I guess?

The section and processing will happen for the locations footnotes are added: src/pages/[...page].astro, src/pages/posts/[slug].astro and src/components/blog/PostPreviewFull.astro
